ePoll
=====

ePOll is a PHP based online Polling/Voting application. This is a fairly simple and easy to use script that anyone having basic knowledge of PHP can use on his/her website.

The script will be using two types of mailing mechanism. Either one can be used based on server configuration.

1. Regular mailing in which user can use any email provider but webmasters must have Mail PEAR installed for this
2. SMTP mailing for this SMTP mail should be enabled on Server

I will keep updating the read-me as I progress on development.
